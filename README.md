# WiFiConnect (without the OLED functionality)
WiFi Manager for ESP8266 and ESP32 chips with support for OLED 128x64 screens

Note: This fork is a copy of https://github.com/smurf0969/WiFiConnect but with the OLED components (.h, .cpp) files REMOVED ironically because smurf's re-implementation of [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) is much cleaner and I do not require the need for OLED support, nor does it compile without it.

Enhancements made in this fork will be pushed upstream to the benefit of smurf0969's library.

Refer to the original https://github.com/smurf0969/WiFiConnect library for the full package.
